# 🚀 GitLab Setup & Run Using Docker

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up and run GitLab using Docker on a local machine.  
The goal of this task is to understand Docker containerization, image pulling, container execution, and accessing GitLab locally.

GitLab Community Edition (CE) is pulled from Docker Hub and run using Docker Desktop.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Docker Desktop
- GitLab Community Edition (CE)
- Docker Hub
- Web Browser (Localhost)

## 📦 Step 1: Pull GitLab Image from Docker Hub

First, I pulled the official GitLab Community Edition image from Docker Hub.

🔗 Docker Image Link:  
https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ce

### Command Used:
```bash
docker pull gitlab/gitlab-ce:nightly

⏱️ Time Taken: 5–10 minutes
After completion, the GitLab image was successfully available in Docker Desktop.

▶️ Step 2: Run GitLab Container

After pulling the image, I ran the GitLab container with port mapping.
Command Used: docker run -p 8000:80 gitlab/gitlab-ce

⏱️ Time Taken: 5–8 minutes
The container started successfully and GitLab services were initialized.

🌐 Step 3: Access GitLab on Browser

Once the container was running, GitLab was accessed using:
http://localhost:8000/
GitLab prompted for username and password.

🔐 Step 4: Get GitLab Root Password
To retrieve the default root password, the following command was executed:

docker exec -it bd6e0f1444aa cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
This command displays the initial root password generated by GitLab.

✅ Step 5: Login to GitLab Dashboard

Username: root

Password: Retrieved from previous step

After successful login, the GitLab dashboard was displayed.

Understood container execution and port mapping

Learned how GitLab runs inside a Docker container

Retrieved credentials from a running container

Successfully accessed GitLab locally

📌 Conclusion

Running GitLab on Docker is a fast and efficient way to set up a self-hosted DevOps platform for learning and practice. This task helped me strengthen my Docker and GitLab fundamentals.
